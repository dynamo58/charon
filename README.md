# About

Charon (/ˈkɛərɒn/) is an Twitch chat client. Alternative to Chatterino of sorts. It aims to claim that position by (eventually) implementing as many features of native as possible, like:

- predictions,
- voting,
- channel points & redemptions.

Also community theming and plugin extensionality should be relatively easily achievable, due to the program being WebView.

## Name

The name comes from Greek mythology, where Charon is the name of a ferryman bringing the dead across the river Acheron into the underworld.
