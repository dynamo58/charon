# About

Charon (/ˈkɛərɒn/) is an Twitch chat client. Alternative to Chatterino of sorts. It aims to claim that position by (eventually) implementing all the features of native, like:

- predictions,
- voting,
- channel points & redemptions.

Also community theming and plugin extensionality should be relatively easily achievable, due to the program being WebView.

## Name

The program is named after Greek mythology whereby Charon is the name of a ferryman bringing the dead to the underworld across the river Acheron
